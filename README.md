# ArcGIS Pro Layout
This tutorial builds on the ArcGIS Visualization tuorial such that you are expected to have a map created using ArcGIS Pro. The following steps describe some basic pointers for creating a pleasing layout with cartographic elements such as legend, north arrow, scale bar, source statement and title.


----

## Setup Instructions
This tutorial assumes the user has completed the [ArcGIS Visualization](https://brockdsl.github.io/ArcGIS_Visualization/) tutorial.

This map package includes the final result of the ArcGIS Visualization tutorial. Download the [map package](https://github.com/BrockDSL/ArcGIS-Layout/blob/main/TreeSymbols.lpkx) and double-click to run ArcGIS Pro.

----

## Tutorial Steps
Click the **Insert** tab and select New Layout ![image of New Layout button](https://github.com/BrockDSL/ArcGIS-Layout/assets/45638590/df849780-45db-4c30-b1bc-e387b92bbd7a)
Select ANSI - Landscape 8.5" x 11"

The white box that appears is essentially the representation of a piece of letter size paper. It is a good practise to add **guides** so that there is a clean border around the outside of the map and all of its elements.

To be sure the rulers are showing, click the Layout ribbon at the top of the window and check the boxes for Rulers and Guides.

Above the white box you will see the ruler, right-click on the ruler and select **Add Guides...** Make sure to select GUIDES (plural) or you will end up with a single guide where you don't want it.

From the dialogue box, make the following selections:
- Orientation: BOTH
- Placement: Offset from edge
- Position: 0.5 in

Click OK to add the guides. When you add any element to the layout, DO NOT ALLOW ANY PART TO CROSS OVER THE GUIDES.
